Description: This is the R implementation of the algorithm based on KNN to smooth
    scRNA-Seq data, with the goal of significantly improving the signal-to-noise
    ratio of each profile, while largely preserving biological expression
    heterogeneity. The algorithm is based on the observation that across
    platforms, the technical noise exhibited by UMI-filtered scRNA-Seq data
    closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first
    identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based
    on variance-stabilized and partially smoothed expression profiles, and then
    aggregating their UMI counts. See publication: "K-nearest neighbor smoothing
    for high-throughput single-cell RNA-Seq data" (Florian Wagner, Yun Yan, Itai
    Yanai, bioRxiv 217737; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/217737).
